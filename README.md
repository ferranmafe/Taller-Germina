# Taller-Germina
Little HTML project (one single static file) developed to help Germina students to follow Scratch activities. This webpage was done in order to help with volunteer activities in a CCD project (Centre de Cooperació per al Desenvolupament - UPC), in which UPC students helped teenagers in social exclusion risk to be engaged for technology by doing Scratch activities.

This web was done with pure HTML without backend, and served using GitHub Pages. The activities were developed with UPC teachers (Dani Jiménez) in a previous volunteer activity.
